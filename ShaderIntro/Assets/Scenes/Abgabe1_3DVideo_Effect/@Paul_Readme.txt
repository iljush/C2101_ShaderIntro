For this shader i tried to approximate the old 3D movie look(without glasses ofc).
I went through many iterations and returned to a simple version i liked best.
(now named "Final"). If you press play in the monkey3dScene you get a preview
of 4 different settings of this shader.
It´s a rather simple shader, but i wanted to try something I haven´t seen yet
and i like the result. Sadly the Susannes scale is wierd due to blender 
export and thats why some of the shaders settings have to have tiny values.
